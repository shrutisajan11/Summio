hi a.d i'm dakota welcome to my house
[Music]
[Music]
i moved here about five years ago and it
was the second house i looked at and the
first house i ever bought i love wood
and i love light and windows and greens
so i just fell in love ryan murphy lived
in this house first and he loved it so
much too but his family got bigger so he
moved out
lucky and this is the living room i hang
out in here i read people kind of are
always coming in and out of my house and
everyone hangs out in this room
obviously not only because it's a living
room but because it's like one of the
only places to sit the furniture is
vintage and the couches were original
and we recovered them in this amazing
crushed mo hair and this table came with
the house i bought it with the house
which was lucky it's pretty cool on the
bottom it's bamboo the piano is vintage
it's an antique wireless sir i
play like
badly hi that's zeppelin he wants to
show you his dinosaur
this is not an antique this thing but i
have a record collection that goes all
the way and i just alphabetize them
and it's really exciting right now is
ram paul mccartney it's a really great
album and a really great album to listen
to on
vinyl
and this amazing thing happens at
certain times of day like really early
in the morning 7am light from the sun on
the pool does this on the ceiling and i
think it's the coolest
[Music]
this is my office i read scripts in here
i have meetings in here sometimes i
actually don't really get any work done
because i get distracted by everything
that's in here my favorite thing about
it i guess is these bookshelves that i
built into the walls originally they
were just these really beautiful like
clean wood slabs and then they started
to fall because i have a lot of books
these
ones
were sent to me by patti smith i said i
love your poetry so much i love your
work and so she wrote me little notes
and all of these
books that she sent me
this is a weird pile don't focus on this
pile of books let's just put these ones
in a different
we'll just put them down here go to a
cooler pile this is cool it's a wax
mushroom
this i was working with chanel a long
time ago and my alias was punk rock and
i thought that was funny they're silly
awards i don't even know i'm not an
awards person barb is such a great
character barb didn't come back in
season two did she they totally forgot
about barb in the upside down that sucks
she's still there oh sex in the
constitution that's a really interesting
one sex religion and law from america's
origins oh jesus
what a weird girl
this was a polaroid of hunter thompson
who was my dad's best friend and a very
dear like godfather figure to me and i
love it so much
even with his boobies
this is an amazing photographer named
alice mann and she photographs these
marching band girls in south africa and
their energy is amazing and it makes me
feel
hopeful that is a photograph of my
grandma at her house at shambhala with
one of her tigers
[Music]
let's go in the dining room this table
actually we designed it and had it made
i mean it's a smaller room and we didn't
want to lose the
rug and the light and we kind of wanted
the table to disappear and these chairs
look like little
humans they're so gorgeous this i found
on first dibs maybe i love first
dibs
so much i have some crystals yeah this
one is cool because it has a dandelion
inside isn't that so cool people tend to
give crystals as gifts in la and that's
great i love them there's a really big
one over there in the corner that guy
that crystal is crazy and it projects
good vibes into you know the house and
at people
[Music]
this is my little kitchen we painted it
we painted it this green color i love
green i lived in new york before i moved
into this house and then before i moved
to new york i lived in a house and i
painted the kitchen green but i totally
 up the color and it was like the
most atrocious color green it was so
hardcore it looked insane like terrible
but then i got it right on this one i
think
i love cooking i cook a lot and i bake a
lot i love limes i love them they're
great i love them so much and i like to
present them like this in my house and
how cool is this it's dyeing that plant
now that i'm looking at it that's so sad
there we go
i never ever thought that i'd be like a
dish person
because i don't get it at all like the
psychology of it i don't understand why
anyone would collect loads of
dishes or people who have china and like
china cabinets i was always like what
why i don't get it but this
is so cool
here i am with loads of dishes look at
these
never have i used this
what is that for oh it's for teacups got
it
i mean can you stand it
they're the coolest
wouldn't you want a drink out of that
i never do because they're too cool
they're just for sitting in this
cabinet
my company is called tea time pictures
so tea is a big deal for me but also
caffeine is a big deal for me
which i need some of it now
that's upstairs where my bedroom is but
we're not going up there
this is outside i wanted you to see this
table and chairs over here because this
was
made out of the wood from winston
churchill's yacht
i'm not lying and i think that's the
coolest thing ever and look at how these
chairs fit nobody can really sit in this
table because the chairs wobble in these
cracks and the slabs of pavement and
people fall out of them and it
sucks but
isn't that so satisfying and amazing
i planted this tree when i moved in and
it was a little baby and i got some
whoppers of lemons on that one but this
one
look they're like perfectly placed
oranges on this tree can you believe
that
how beautifully they're placed it's like
i did it for this very reason this was
meant to be an herb garden and i never
planted any herbs in it and i'm just
looking at it now and it looks so crazy
in here
i didn't ever do anything and all this
wild started growing in it like this guy
what are you even
weeds you know that on a lot of tea bags
they have little fortunes on the back of
the tea tab
and i really take them very seriously
and one that i get all the time is the
difference between a flower and a weed
is judgment so think about that
[Music]
i finally recently got outdoor furniture
for a while it was looking pretty grim
out here this is like an amazing little
double chair situation that i love it's
one piece i thought it would be really
really pretty if there were some flowers
and things out here because this house
can tend to feel really masculine these
chairs are not meant to be put outside
they're very delicate and expensive but
they look so good out here so who cares
my cat chicken is buried here which is
not funny but i don't know why i think
it's funny to tell you that
the pool's heated a little so i can go
in it all the time and also it doesn't
really get cold here
[Music]
let's go up here these
are
some stairs
that lead you to this place up here
which is
a hot tub
which
is
so cold
bamboo grows so crazy fast i don't know
if you know that and my neighbors on
that side are in a war with me about how
high the bamboo in the driveway is
growing
which is insane
because why would i want people to be
able to see in my house i can't believe
that i'm even letting you guys in my
house so they can just shove it
this is this gorgeous
just randomly placed flower arrangement
and
that's my bedroom sneaky yeah let's go
back downstairs now
zeppelin
oh
don't
what are you gonna do
go get it
that one's probably lost forever
[Music]
[Music]
thank you so much for coming a.d i hope
you liked the tour of my house but i
really would like for you to leave now
so
feed it
[Music]
you
