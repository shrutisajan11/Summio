I am glad to share with you my team project,Summio:Youtube Transcript Summarizer. I had successfully completed my work on the project along with my teammates, Thomas Kannamthanam Thomas, Mishal Rose and Raihana Rasaldeen. 
It was an exciting and thrilling experience for me since it was my first time working on a project. This project aims to help those people that have quite less attention spans and also less patience to watch long videos on Youtube.
So by implementing this project we knew it would be helpful to atleast some people who would love to see the transcripts of the video along with their summarized and translated versions in the same website itself.
Thank you for showing interest in it! Have a great day!
