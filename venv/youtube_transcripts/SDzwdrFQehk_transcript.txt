3.015 --> 3.81
Did you come?

4.66 --> 5.775
I mean, did I come here?

10.72 --> 11.475000000000001
Hello.

18.46 --> 20.875
I just arrived home.

24.21 --> 25.970000000000002
I didn't prepare my glass.

27.08 --> 28.415
Can you wait a little bit?

30.835 --> 31.335
Nice to see you.

31.369 --> 33.285
I came over to Weverse again.

33.59 --> 34.553000000000004
Nice to see you.

55.295 --> 56.36
Is it better to look in the front?

64.107 --> 65.225
Diagonal is better.

65.58 --> 66.825
I think diagonal is better...

66.838 --> 69.579
You can see the blue light behind me.

73.86 --> 74.94
Like this.

79.87 --> 82.73
One second... I will... One second.

89.485 --> 91.08
So, let's see.

95.32 --> 96.55499999999999
Let's make one.

108.605 --> 109.64500000000001
There aren't many things...

122.005 --> 124.3
Please fill up your glass.

128.2 --> 129.44
There isn't much...

141.3 --> 142.29500000000002
This much.

153.191 --> 154.491
How amazing.

169.152 --> 170.49099999999999
I can't mix a lot.

175.56 --> 176.695
So, everyone,

178.49 --> 188.51500000000001
why did I come on the 4th when I could have come earlier on Weverse?

190.515 --> 195.39499999999998
It's because of my solo album!

196.22 --> 203.51
The full album will be released. "GOLDEN".

208.85 --> 212.215
To celebrate it, I will

212.231 --> 214.839
give cheers with you guys.

216.184 --> 217.655
Cheers!

237.625 --> 238.665
That's great.

241.43 --> 243.895
The album name is "GOLDEN".

246.435 --> 252.51500000000001
Golden... When you look at it...

253.93 --> 257.95
After I debuted,

259.7 --> 262.65999999999997
it became my modifier.

264.195 --> 268.71999999999997
Like... There was also Golden Chest.

269.19 --> 274.08
In the variety show, I also wrote a poem called "Golden".

275.44 --> 282.15
And also, this moment is like a golden period for me.

282.86 --> 288.58500000000004
And if you look at it... I think of this as golden time.

291.35 --> 295.04
I decided to name the album "GOLDEN".

302.93 --> 305.065
The album is coming out.

306.22 --> 313.725
Including "3D" and clean version of "Seven"...

313.725 --> 319.012
Along with explicit version, there are a total of 11 tracks.

321.305 --> 326.875
Honestly speaking, I was only thinking about EP.

327.01 --> 333.78499999999997
However, I was doing my best working on the album

335.775 --> 339.515
and it became a full album.

340.94 --> 346.01
And so...

348.65 --> 352.685
I kept practicing even during the listening party.

353.765 --> 358.43
I was practicing on things that are

358.451 --> 360.225
related to the next album.

361.105 --> 364.83500000000004
It's not like there is no performance.

364.835 --> 370.70799999999997
Of course, everyone related to the main...
It's the title song. Title song.

370.71 --> 374.91999999999996
The title song must have a performance.

375.359 --> 377.018
I am practicing hard on that.

377.224 --> 381.265
I want to do my best practicing the performance

382.346 --> 383.627
and I really

386.98 --> 388.725
want to show it to you soon.

388.75 --> 391.645
I am really doing my best.

391.697 --> 394.598
I am putting all the determination

397.765 --> 399.76
into my voice and body. For real.

401.555 --> 403.895
I feel this while practicing these days...

408.995 --> 413.675
It really "died".

414.615 --> 419.575
I wasn't like this before.

419.58 --> 422.365
I feel like this when I am dancing.

424.428 --> 426.269
It's exhausting that weigh on the body.

427.905 --> 432.84
But it's inevitable to try my best. I will do that.

435.19 --> 439.77
Anyway... It's finally coming out like this.

440.695 --> 445.135
You guys have talked about album...

445.745 --> 448.294
You guys talked about album a lot.

449.64 --> 457.06
I'm really sorry that I finally let you hear my songs now

458.305 --> 462.325
and on the other hand, the fact

462.671 --> 467.965
that I am able to let you hear many of my songs with my voices

467.965 --> 473.11999999999995
is very valuable for me.

474.92 --> 475.84000000000003
And so...

479.495 --> 482.45
I am sorry and I am also very thankful that you guys waited for me.

482.815 --> 485.2
I will do my best again.

485.436 --> 487.589
There is nothing that is making me stressed out.

489.66 --> 491.5
I am just tired...

494.364 --> 496.21299999999997
If I am tired, early...

503.945 --> 507.2
I think I can say this much.

507.285 --> 508.769
I did "Seven"

510.975 --> 513.6650000000001
and I also did "3D"... I did.

514.425 --> 519.66
The title song for this album

522.265 --> 525.46
was very difficult.

526.75 --> 530.51
I want to say that it's really difficult.

530.51 --> 535.067
This also be expressed as saying that it will be awesome?

537.8 --> 540.3
I think you guys will really like it.

542.03 --> 545.92
You can look forward to it. I am confident.

552.525 --> 557.8
So anyway... I think there are everything I wanted to say.

559.93 --> 560.805
It's not a cold.

560.812 --> 563.495
I am purposely holding the weight down.

564.38 --> 566.865
Since the full album is coming out,

566.873 --> 571.3290000000001
I wanted to lower my voice, so please understand that.

571.487 --> 578.134
I wanted to be calm and having older bro vibe.

580.06 --> 581.18
You know what that is, right?

582.84 --> 584.695
I wanted to go with older bro vibe.

586.885 --> 589.05
Okay, cheer up!

590.448 --> 591.4549999999999
Cheers.

603.08 --> 608.135
And everyone! What is it?

609.44 --> 610.2600000000001
I...

613.092 --> 614.367
I don't know.

615.76 --> 619.105
I'm sort of tired. I haven't been sleeping well.

622.105 --> 626.595
I also practiced very hard today.

628.1 --> 631.15
The rest of the schedules are hellish too.

635.48 --> 637.38
I am quite worried...

640.475 --> 642.52
I am really worried, actually.

649.325 --> 654.59
I think a lot about, "Will I be good at this"?

666.205 --> 670.2800000000001
I went to go get an IV.

672.57 --> 673.835
I got an IV.

674.54 --> 676.3349999999999
I wanted to replenish my strength.

677.0 --> 679.015
I didn't eat anything today.

679.355 --> 681.075
Today, what is it?

681.389 --> 684.95
I have to take care of my body too.

686.92 --> 690.4449999999999
It's not like I am getting stressed... Don't worry about it.

693.5 --> 697.06
I am just tired.

701.05 --> 704.6099999999999
"Jung Kook, do well". I will do well. I will do well.

705.3 --> 707.14
I have to do my best.

710.63 --> 714.055
Does Jung Kook love TAEHYUN? TAE... TAEHYUN??

714.755 --> 716.66
Our TOMORROW X TOGETHER TAEHYUN?

718.32 --> 722.8100000000001
I happened to talk on the phone with TAEHYUN today.

725.02 --> 731.2049999999999
TAEHYUN... He's so well-mannered and cute.

732.49 --> 736.58
He's cute while being sort of like old soul.

738.26 --> 740.45
I think he knows more than me?

741.48 --> 742.4350000000001
I am just...

745.95 --> 748.44
I gave up on studying to walk on this path.

748.558 --> 750.116
There is nothing in my head.

752.055 --> 754.4399999999999
TAEHYUN is a great friend.

755.44 --> 756.575
He is charismatic.

759.04 --> 760.5749999999999
I am drinking high ball. High ball.

770.93 --> 773.5999999999999
"I really missed you". Thank you.

775.225 --> 777.19
"Hello, I am a girlfriend of Jung Kook".

779.185 --> 781.505
What are you doing at this hour?

791.1 --> 793.275
To say that I have nothing...

796.38 --> 799.075
It's true that my academic root is shorter.

805.195 --> 806.98
"I really love you a lot".

809.52 --> 811.37
I think I love you more.

813.735 --> 819.275
I think I love ARMY more.

822.255 --> 823.495
So, what did you say?

824.468 --> 827.5519999999999
"Can you tell the teachers to stop the class"?

828.295 --> 831.115
Class... It's not the concept of class.

831.623 --> 834.224
For me, that's not the case.

835.29 --> 838.395
The process of practicing is the actual game.

840.16 --> 843.395
I mean... There needs to be the foundation

845.92 --> 849.495
and so it's not like I am taking a test.

850.645 --> 852.535
Anyway, practices are real for me.

857.38 --> 859.195
Take off my shirt?

860.9 --> 863.665
Hey man...

867.66 --> 870.24
You pervert.

877.145 --> 879.36
Watch that in another place.

882.705 --> 885.34
Why do you... Why are you saying that to me.

887.082 --> 888.3439999999999
It's embarrassing.

892.29 --> 895.8399999999999
I recently received this magazine.

899.72 --> 906.01
This is the hip hop genre that I like the most.

914.355 --> 915.395
This is great.

917.595 --> 921.6850000000001
Notice for the album release date came up now...

921.685 --> 923.827
It makes me feel a bit relieved.

923.989 --> 928.49
I hoped that ARMY fans can know about this quickly.

944.261 --> 945.4789999999999
But still...

946.0 --> 947.875
My skin looks great here.

948.341 --> 951.631
My skin has been bad these days... There are many scars.

953.59 --> 955.11
Is it because the lighting is reddish?

955.473 --> 959.425
It must cover the scars since scars and lights are both red.

959.453 --> 961.577
Okay. My live will be in this color from now on.

968.015 --> 970.655
Right now... Are there translations going on??

971.64 --> 973.875
The Weverse comments are a bit slow.

974.048 --> 975.721
I can just answer them.

975.748 --> 977.1030000000001
Are there translations going on?

977.935 --> 980.0
Just say yes or no.

980.54 --> 985.1999999999999
If there is no translation, you might not understand this either.

998.86 --> 1001.42
Can you not hear my voice?? That's not it.

1002.97 --> 1004.0450000000001
Everyone right now...

1006.68 --> 1007.81
What you are saying...

1014.9 --> 1018.665
The Weverse chatting is really slow.

1019.255 --> 1023.035
It comes up after 10 seconds.

1024.405 --> 1027.29
Like 10 seconds? It comes up after 13 seconds.

1028.885 --> 1029.98
I see.

1033.74 --> 1035.44
The reason for deleting T*kTok is...

1038.5 --> 1041.87
I put it up for fun

1043.59 --> 1045.5349999999999
but on my T*kTok...

1047.72 --> 1052.6200000000001
I wished that only awesome dances or

1052.62 --> 1055.9779999999998
dance challenges and covers will go up.

1055.978 --> 1058.862
I thought like that so I erased it.

1060.955 --> 1065.105
ARMY was able to share it and make it dispersed well though.

1067.39 --> 1069.1650000000002
Anyway, as long as it's not on my T*kTok.

1069.205 --> 1072.194
Or else, I will put it up on the story or something.

1078.315 --> 1080.97
Today is JEONGHAN's birthday from SEVENTEEN.

1080.995 --> 1084.407
I met JEONGHAN several times. JEONGHAN.

1085.12 --> 1086.37
Happy birthday!

1096.465 --> 1097.705
Can I sing?

1098.26 --> 1100.51
I moved the speaker to this side.

1101.23 --> 1104.505
I think I can sing then?

1107.045 --> 1109.625
It was way over there before...

1109.652 --> 1112.75
I have to hear it though so I had to raise the volume of the speaker.

1112.75 --> 1115.239
Since it's very close now...

1115.985 --> 1119.108
I tested a bit.

1120.255 --> 1121.9
Seeing that there is no talk about it...

1124.14 --> 1125.265
I think it's all right.

1137.63 --> 1139.0600000000002
Let's talk in English?

1142.711 --> 1147.248
"Let's talk in English"? Nah.

1150.59 --> 1151.615
It's hard.

1153.9 --> 1161.44
English is so difficult.

1170.245 --> 1172.5749999999998
The comments are very slow.

1172.678 --> 1176.325
The good thing about ST*TIONHEAD is...

1178.2 --> 1180.78
There are instantaneously responses from ARMY.

1182.71 --> 1184.325
Weverse is a bit slow.

1184.556 --> 1187.334
It might be slower since there are translations going on.

1200.759 --> 1202.576
"Korean is sexy".

1204.125 --> 1208.595
That's right. Korean... Korean is the most...

1208.87 --> 1212.6599999999999
I honestly think the language is the hardest.

1214.005 --> 1219.24
I don't know other languages well

1219.29 --> 1221.46
because I don't know that many...

1221.836 --> 1226.681
I think Korean is the language that has many ways to express things.

1226.839 --> 1228.548
It's such a language of variety.

1229.045 --> 1233.41
Korean language... I think

1234.256 --> 1236.8000000000002
King Sejong is really amazing for making Korean.

1237.235 --> 1239.2749999999999
How can the language express things so well??

1242.955 --> 1246.35
English... Other languages now...

1247.45 --> 1250.57
When we interpret it... There are interpreters.

1251.38 --> 1254.7600000000002
But for every interpreter,

1256.81 --> 1259.12
there is also distinct characteristics.

1260.455 --> 1263.835
But the texture becomes a bit different.

1264.047 --> 1266.3020000000001
When we look at song interpretations...

1266.72 --> 1268.19
Each one is different.

1268.765 --> 1271.285
That's why it's fascinating for me when I see it.

1273.415 --> 1275.24
You want to see me really laugh?

1282.475 --> 1284.25
This is finished? All right. All right.

1284.929 --> 1285.996
I will fill it up. I will fill it up.

1289.495 --> 1291.9799999999998
ARMY is making me drink now.

1301.42 --> 1305.1000000000001
Should I drink everything in this? There isn't much left.

1315.902 --> 1317.452
*van Williams.

1349.14 --> 1352.2800000000002
Should I call it a cup holder? What do you call this?

1352.58 --> 1355.72
Cup coasters? I don't have that.

1356.72 --> 1361.46
I am using the wet tissue.

1364.98 --> 1366.04
Great.

1374.87 --> 1377.395
Even if I spill it while mixing it,

1377.5 --> 1380.554
everything will be absorbed to the tissue.

1388.565 --> 1390.895
"It will be more delicious to include T*quila in the beverage".

1391.709 --> 1393.578
I can't drink T*quila.

1394.064 --> 1398.611
For me, no for champagne and T*equila.

1399.605 --> 1400.815
I am gone.

1402.9 --> 1404.52
I am just gone.

1407.98 --> 1409.4
You want to have a drink with me?

1410.39 --> 1413.555
Should... Should I call out my address??

1415.82 --> 1418.1599999999999
I think you all know my address??

1418.88 --> 1420.355
Everything is already up.

1425.07 --> 1426.57
You all know my address.

1427.99 --> 1429.975
I think you can get it when searching it on Y*utube?

1433.065 --> 1435.02
But I don't pay attention to that.

1437.32 --> 1439.195
I think of it as my fate.

1439.985 --> 1441.82
I just look what's in front of me.

1442.74 --> 1446.72
I will just chase the future along with ARMY.

1447.735 --> 1452.12
How can I pay attention to all of these details?

1457.46 --> 1459.07
Should I play songs?

1462.72 --> 1464.6000000000001
You want me to call out my address??

1465.89 --> 1467.48
But you really can't visit me.

1504.65 --> 1506.23
The song that I am playing right now

1506.785 --> 1509.805
was recommended

1519.83 --> 1525.3799999999999
by a dancer who did activities with me during "3D".

1525.38 --> 1528.565
The song was so good that I listen to this song a lot.

1532.145 --> 1535.9
The song is called, "21", and it's great.

1540.005 --> 1541.5700000000002
I will be like this today...

1543.21 --> 1544.006
And let's rest.

1579.615 --> 1583.88
I... The place where I shoot T*kTok videos...

1588.165 --> 1589.545
It's over here. Over here.

1594.447 --> 1595.3329999999999
You know what it is?

1597.055 --> 1598.0700000000002
It's over here. Over here.

1598.473 --> 1602.276
I have my own camera.

1603.75 --> 1605.92
Then I will put it here...

1606.56 --> 1608.02
I place it like this.

1608.93 --> 1610.5800000000002
And I will dance here.

1613.44 --> 1614.52
I dance like this.

1627.59 --> 1630.26
And then I will edit it.

1661.84 --> 1663.08
I do it like this.

1679.94 --> 1680.68
What is it?

1683.8 --> 1687.78
"In this bitter world, I am the sweet melody"? Yes.

1762.047 --> 1763.3
"Did you eat some"?

1772.101 --> 1773.5870000000002
I didn't eat yet.

1776.095 --> 1777.08
What should I eat?

1783.758 --> 1784.992
What do I eat?

1789.201 --> 1792.134
What... What...

1793.14 --> 1797.4950000000001
What with... What do... What do... What will do it?

1799.085 --> 1801.4560000000001
What will... Do...

1809.385 --> 1811.22
You want me to play j-hope's song?

1811.4 --> 1813.8600000000001
j-hope. I miss j-hope.

1819.146 --> 1820.2179999999998
"Arson".

1822.062 --> 1823.3519999999999
"Arson".

2011.285 --> 2012.3000000000002
How great.

2122.476 --> 2123.495
I'm so tired.

2147.455 --> 2149.511
I have to finish isolation. Isolation.

2417.815 --> 2418.62
How tiring.

2426.685 --> 2427.7799999999997
It's rest a bit.

2430.41 --> 2431.345
It's tiring.

2437.28 --> 2439.09
"Calm down"? All right.

2443.035 --> 2444.2599999999998
All right.

2445.22 --> 2446.14
Okay.

2446.845 --> 2449.52
Let's go with all the major songs for the members.

2451.042 --> 2452.869
And then...

2454.315 --> 2455.3
Let's see.

2505.48 --> 2506.7
I have to do something?

2563.565 --> 2566.18
I was... I was going to do something.

2568.32 --> 2569.7400000000002
It will not be fun.

2570.7 --> 2572.04
I was going to do something...

2573.5 --> 2574.81
I think it will not be fun?

2679.245 --> 2680.62
How was it? My build-up.

2681.753 --> 2683.882
This is what you call a build-up.

2684.77 --> 2686.24
I twist it.

2689.66 --> 2690.71
Up to here.

2693.465 --> 2694.36
You saw it?

2735.205 --> 2736.6749999999997
Of course the ending is...

2759.94 --> 2761.305
There is no more alcohol.

2773.672 --> 2775.578
There is no alcohol.

2777.108 --> 2778.3450000000003
There is no whiskey.

2790.62 --> 2791.89
"'Super Tuna'".

2795.405 --> 2798.0600000000004
Why is Jin's song "Super Tuna"?

2806.26 --> 2809.2400000000002
No, I went to see the dermatologist and something was on the ear.

2809.305 --> 2811.826
I don't like putting things on me for a long time.

2820.82 --> 2821.96
"'3D'"?

2829.34 --> 2831.08
"3D" is difficult.

2839.1 --> 2840.8399999999997
Do you have S*ntori Whiskey?

2846.92 --> 2850.94
Right now, you have S*ntori Whiskey that you can give to me right now.

2853.76 --> 2854.7000000000003
Hand!

2856.34 --> 2860.42
You have S*ntori Whiskey right now and
you can bring it to me. Hand!

2863.48 --> 2864.78
Put your hands up!

2878.16 --> 2879.335
"'Super Tuna'".

2895.78 --> 2897.42
You can really bring it?

2898.36 --> 2900.2650000000003
Oh my... You have to in your house?

2905.045 --> 2907.775
Then give it to my security guy.

2912.54 --> 2914.38
No.. I am just asking.

2957.82 --> 2963.05
"I have a test tomorrow. Please wish me luck.
Stress is killing me".

2963.256 --> 2965.123
Don't get stressed out.

2966.336 --> 2968.051
Don't stress.

2975.08 --> 2978.7999999999997
Don't get stressed out and you will take the exam well.

2980.7 --> 2982.1749999999997
You can do it!

2983.32 --> 2989.6600000000003
ARMY.... ARMY's... ARMY, show what it is first.
The power of ARMY.

3100.705 --> 3102.795
Jin too...

3108.845 --> 3111.5249999999996
Jin isn't normal, either.

3113.661 --> 3114.683
How can he...

3116.328 --> 3118.087
I don't think I could do it.

3121.38 --> 3124.86
I think... It's like...
Is he doing it for ARMY?

3126.7 --> 3129.835
ARMY fans know what kind of image Jin is.

3131.18 --> 3134.79
He doesn't have just a normal wildness.

3136.289 --> 3137.1890000000003
But...

3140.03 --> 3143.1400000000003
To think about releasing it as a song.

3144.305 --> 3146.4849999999997
Right. There is just first verse.

3153.66 --> 3157.72
Jin is also like real, wild person.

3159.0 --> 3161.37
Because of this side of him,

3162.588 --> 3165.875
there is a reason our team is so bright.

3166.325 --> 3170.2599999999998
Jin really grabs this part of our team.

3173.78 --> 3176.1800000000003
I really want to see the members.

3190.72 --> 3192.5449999999996
I want to see the members. Members.

3197.35 --> 3199.609
I miss my members.

3201.323 --> 3202.758
BTS.

3213.315 --> 3214.585
Why are you imitating me?

3214.791 --> 3216.7830000000004
"Sorry, my editing is getting late. One second".

3221.16 --> 3223.24
What flavor is the candle?

3225.12 --> 3226.94
The smell is really good.

3228.88 --> 3230.7400000000002
If you ask me to eat the candle...

3232.21 --> 3233.92
Aren't you telling me to just die?

3235.68 --> 3239.6
Don't eat this. Everyone. You aren't supposed to eat the candle.

3241.66 --> 3245.325
You have to lit the candle and ventilate the room.

3305.02 --> 3306.74
There were some left!

3308.7 --> 3310.1
You didn't know.

3367.28 --> 3369.94
I thought nothing will work but everything just works.

3370.32 --> 3372.2000000000003
That's how it is.

3395.58 --> 3400.24
Looking at Jin... Looking at Jin's music video,
this is quite fascinating.

3409.82 --> 3411.96
This is very smokey.

3412.98 --> 3413.82
Great.

3417.76 --> 3419.13
So, now.

3421.14 --> 3422.7599999999998
Now...

3434.58 --> 3437.72
This song really seems to be popular.

3489.325 --> 3490.75
Did we connect?

3514.965 --> 3516.19
"First flight tomorrow".

3516.805 --> 3520.145
First flight... Don't get nervous and fighting!

3525.5 --> 3527.16
This cup isn't that big?

3529.84 --> 3530.915
It's the size of the hand.

3531.78 --> 3533.0400000000004
It's not that big.

3534.7 --> 3536.2
Just the center here.

3547.645 --> 3549.315
Did MINGYU cut his hair??

3553.68 --> 3555.5
He said that he cut his hair?

3558.363 --> 3559.8379999999997
I should ask him to take the photo.

3599.92 --> 3605.78
We heard j-hope's song and we heard Jimin's song...
V and Jin...

3607.18 --> 3609.0
And then RM.

3610.86 --> 3613.52
And there is SUGA left.

3617.4 --> 3619.775
RM's song is great, right? It's great.

3620.44 --> 3622.795
All of the members' songs are great.

3623.56 --> 3626.003
Members' colors are so different.

3645.74 --> 3650.2349999999997
"After you resume activities in 2025,

3650.235 --> 3655.828
what do you want all the members to do together"?

3656.265 --> 3659.1369999999997
Of course, what can it be, everyone??

3666.0 --> 3667.88
What can it obviously be?

3671.48 --> 3674.505
What can it obviously be? Quickly make an album

3676.02 --> 3678.92
and quickly come out

3679.26 --> 3680.8650000000002
to see you guys.

3681.72 --> 3683.825
Other than that, there is no other way.

3685.84 --> 3688.1400000000003
That has to be the first priority, of course.

3690.33 --> 3692.9249999999997
There is no reason to ask that question.

3693.99 --> 3696.785
We have to come together

3697.595 --> 3700.58
and from that moment,

3703.06 --> 3705.06
we have to find the way

3706.16 --> 3710.37
to come out as quickly as possible.

3710.37 --> 3712.3199999999997
That's the right thing to do.

3722.37 --> 3726.44
That's right. We will do "BON VOYAGE".

3728.83 --> 3731.42
We will do "IN THE SOOP".

3734.05 --> 3735.71
How... This is...

3739.4 --> 3741.14
I mean, really...

3749.09 --> 3758.15
I hope that you guys know how much we think of you guys.

3761.52 --> 3766.38
We all have our personal matters...

3767.72 --> 3769.745
The song suddenly started playing.

3774.9 --> 3779.9900000000002
We will have our own personal things
and we don't know what's going to happen.

3781.185 --> 3782.611
That's including me too.

3786.79 --> 3792.563
I hope that you know how much I think of you guys.

3792.563 --> 3794.839
We really think of you guys a lot

3797.3 --> 3798.52
and honestly,

3800.36 --> 3804.81
we want to look awesome in front of you guys

3805.134 --> 3807.962
or we want to give strength to you guys...

3808.423 --> 3813.9939999999997
Or like... We want to make you think like that
and that's why we are doing our best.

3814.94 --> 3820.645
To do this job right now and... Oh, what is it?

3821.673 --> 3826.624
You are the reason that we are doing all of this... You guys.

3829.26 --> 3832.0750000000003
You are the reason. Our reason.

3833.0 --> 3836.91
What if I am so awesome? What if I am?

3838.72 --> 3840.83
Because I am awesome,

3842.42 --> 3847.3
do I just take everything away

3848.7 --> 3854.02
from the things that you guys gave me?
I can't do that.

3856.3 --> 3859.54
I know what my top priority is.

3860.96 --> 3865.04
I hope that you know that you are the reason.

3867.94 --> 3869.26
For real.

3870.0 --> 3872.0
How did I end up talking about this?

3874.28 --> 3878.28
It began by answering what I want to do in 2025.

3879.92 --> 3881.46
That's the one.

3881.96 --> 3884.674
We will do our best to release a new song.

3884.674 --> 3887.054
We come back in an awesome way.

3888.74 --> 3894.85
Including the members... Approximately 2 years...

3895.635 --> 3897.2650000000003
Imagine that's how much time it passed.

3898.32 --> 3900.38
But it shouldn't be less than that.

3901.0 --> 3901.86
Right?

3902.288 --> 3904.075
What should we do? We have to try our best.

3906.28 --> 3908.1800000000003
We must try our best.

3908.96 --> 3914.245
We can't fall back and we have to be more awesome that others...

3915.18 --> 3921.605
We mustn't forget that there are those rooting for BTS.

3922.22 --> 3927.1099999999997
We have to get more awesome so that others think that way.

3928.08 --> 3929.264
What should we do then?

3929.745 --> 3931.8269999999998
We have to train. We must train.

3932.964 --> 3935.62
We have to do our best. Release the album.

3937.14 --> 3940.56
We have to meet all the ARMY fans around the world.

3941.26 --> 3944.7450000000003
The stories that seven members didn't get to say.

3945.517 --> 3947.732
We will reveal it by doing shootings...

3947.732 --> 3953.08
We will let your ears get pleased and let you watch our shows.

3953.96 --> 3956.36
"BTS is this kind of team"!

3958.02 --> 3960.94
We will show that. There is nothing else.

3962.76 --> 3970.1450000000004
What I want to do and what members each want to do.
We can do that later.

3970.5 --> 3973.76
We can do it while the members do the activities together.

3973.76 --> 3976.5840000000003
Anyway, chapter 2 has begun.

3977.22 --> 3982.825
If it started, the members also would agree about
what the number one priority is.

3982.825 --> 3984.897
Number one priority is about the group.

3985.4 --> 3987.04
Group is the first.

3987.575 --> 3992.261
Even if someone curses close by...

3992.261 --> 3996.595
Like someone might throw stones which will always not change.

3997.74 --> 3999.5699999999997
After that...

4000.64 --> 4006.3199999999997
Members will anyway... Since time has passed.

4006.32 --> 4010.683
Members definitely will talk about what they personally want to do...
Including me. Including me.

4010.92 --> 4014.9700000000003
I will also talk about what I want to do.
"I also want to do this". This will definitely happen.

4014.97 --> 4017.3819999999996
And it's not only about music...

4017.382 --> 4022.489
In various fields, members might be doing certain activities.

4023.62 --> 4027.1099999999997
These things much be 2nd priority.

4027.11 --> 4032.654
When the group is together though, there are things we must do.

4033.185 --> 4036.0
That's the first thing.

4036.0 --> 4038.13
This is the only thing I hope you know.

4038.13 --> 4045.1110000000003
That's how much members and I think of you as our first priority.

4045.9 --> 4049.52
You just have to know that.

4055.14 --> 4056.3399999999997
That's right.

4072.655 --> 4075.715
What did you say? One second. I didn't see it.
It was a funny one.

4077.66 --> 4078.4849999999997
That's right.

4079.158 --> 4083.567
BTS... But this order is correct.

4083.567 --> 4085.415
Since ARMY is here, there is BTS.

4085.415 --> 4088.351
To say there is ARMY because of BTS is not valid.

4088.76 --> 4090.155
All right?

4090.155 --> 4094.8630000000003
ARMY is here. Because ARMY is here, BTS is here.

4096.48 --> 4099.687
BTS also... Well...

4099.687 --> 4103.912
Anyway, including myself and the members, we are all awesome.

4103.912 --> 4108.668000000001
Since we show that, ARMY shows support and sends love.

4108.98 --> 4112.839999999999
We definitely have to pay back what you gave us.

4114.82 --> 4116.24
It's like that.

4123.115 --> 4124.57
I am talking about our team...

4130.56 --> 4131.740000000001
"Jeon Jimin"??

4132.66 --> 4135.0599999999995
You combined Jimin and me?

4135.38 --> 4138.055
Ah that's right. I have to play SUGA's song.

4138.68 --> 4141.5
RM! I heard your song well.

4141.5 --> 4143.064
You are an awesome person as always.

4149.448 --> 4152.712
♪ This song is Haegeum.

4152.712 --> 4153.997
We have to hear this also.

4157.81 --> 4158.77
Can you hear it?

4169.18 --> 4172.6900000000005
How can all the members have such different taste in music?

4172.69 --> 4174.263999999999
Isn't that so fascinating?

4178.78 --> 4182.98
I think we are all outstanding.

4186.24 --> 4189.141
We are so great. We are group of outstanding people.

4189.141 --> 4194.866
Since I am with these people,
I was able to mature well.

4199.89 --> 4201.92
Anyway, I am going to end the show after this glass.

4203.59 --> 4204.68
All right?

4213.465 --> 4215.825
SUGA sometimes said this.

4215.825 --> 4219.07
"Hey! Why aren't you doing the Haegeum challenge"?

4219.706 --> 4222.162
He said, "I thought you would do it".

4223.88 --> 4229.5
I will do it. I will do the dance.

4231.162 --> 4234.25
It's not soon. I don't know about soon...

4237.03 --> 4239.045
Anyway, it will go up on my T*kTok.

4240.63 --> 4243.996
I will do that. Even if I can't do it with you, I will do it.

4252.385 --> 4253.66
From here.

4262.13 --> 4263.5
Which part is the hardest??

4264.815 --> 4266.96
I will do the hardest part. Hardest part.

4275.25 --> 4277.585
SUGA was sort of upset...

4278.336 --> 4279.42
"Hey, Jung Kook"!

4280.34 --> 4285.9800000000005
"Hey, Jeon Jung Kook! I thought you would do it
but why aren't you doing 'Haegeum'"?

4292.95 --> 4296.554999999999
"Haegeum" dance is hard. It does look hard.

4297.992 --> 4300.335
Or who am I, everyone?

4301.222 --> 4302.621999999999
Say my name!

4303.507 --> 4304.958
Say my name!

4309.875 --> 4311.43
Who am I?

4315.088 --> 4316.250999999999
JK.

4317.11 --> 4318.25
I do everything.

4328.1 --> 4331.18
Let me use the toilet.

4342.193 --> 4343.5830000000005
Toilet. Toilet.

4344.193 --> 4346.294
Restroom, restroom. Let's go. Let's go.

4360.892 --> 4362.735
The lights are off??

4515.58 --> 4518.0599999999995
Why didn't you tell me that I have sweat marks here??

4518.867 --> 4519.952
Can you see these?

4526.08 --> 4528.08
These are all sweat.

4528.88 --> 4531.46
That's how much I am doing my best right now.

4531.72 --> 4533.56
I really sweated a lot.

4537.32 --> 4539.075
It's so difficult...

4540.895 --> 4542.385
And what's the reason for doing this?

4542.408 --> 4544.049
It's because of you guys.

4548.66 --> 4549.76
I drank it all!

4575.62 --> 4578.3
I will end this with my song.

4607.25 --> 4608.25
Me?

4609.025 --> 4610.974999999999
I am a bit drunk.

4628.55 --> 4629.54
No... I will end here.

4630.215 --> 4631.14
I will not drink more.

4633.57 --> 4635.383
I have to practice tomorrow too.

4637.509 --> 4640.654
I don't know. I don't know if I will drink more.

4640.856 --> 4642.398999999999
For now, it's over.

4664.68 --> 4666.18
Anyway...

4717.115 --> 4719.07
We heard "Slow Dancing" before.

4722.358 --> 4728.295
I will say bye after hearing "3D" also.

4753.96 --> 4757.32
Let's hear "3D" too and say bye.

4757.88 --> 4758.84
All right?

4947.82 --> 4950.24
It was Jung Kook's

4952.335 --> 4954.49
Weverse live.

4956.079 --> 4957.306
Thank you.

4962.0 --> 4963.22
Thank you.

4965.24 --> 4967.3949999999995
Bye, bye.

4967.75 --> 4968.9
Bye guys.

4970.5 --> 4971.565
See you next time.

4973.675 --> 4974.77
"Are you eating something at night"?

4974.77 --> 4976.97
I will not. I have to lose weight.

4981.765 --> 4983.609
I have to do diet.

4985.715 --> 4987.055
You know what I am saying?

4987.78 --> 4988.7699999999995
This was great.

4994.745 --> 4996.375
It was fun.

4996.87 --> 4998.39
Thank you guys.

4999.645 --> 5000.8
I will go.

5001.385 --> 5004.305
Anyway, please look forward to the album!

5004.955 --> 5006.24
And ARMY!

5006.325 --> 5011.174
Don't forget that I am always thinking of you guys.

5011.706 --> 5016.585
Have a wonderful night and have a great day.

5017.671 --> 5019.055
Thank you.

5028.265 --> 5029.585
Thank you.

5038.175 --> 5039.03

5040.457 --> 5041.687
Bye.
