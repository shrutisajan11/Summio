there was an idea
to bring together
a group of remarkable people
to see if we could become something more
[Music]
so when they needed us
we could fight the battles
that they never could
[Music]
in time
you will know what it's like to lose
to feel so desperately that you're right
yet to fail all the same
dread it
[Applause]
run from it
destiny still arrives
[Music]
evacuate the city
engage all defenses
and get this man a shield
[Music]
[Music]
fun isn't something one considers when
balancing the universe
but this
does put a smile on my face
[Music]
[Music]
who the hell are you guys
[Music]
you
